                        I make video games in my spare time mostly using the Unity game engine. Check <a href="https://jkjeldsteen.itch.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style={{color: "#777a99"}}>it out here</a>.
                        I have for example reinterpreted <a href="https://jkjeldsteen.itch.io/warthog-defence" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style={{color: "#777a99"}}>Asteroids</a>,

                    <p>In the fifth semester of my computer science education, we collaborated with JP/Politiken to develop a Proof of Concept for an internally owned Consent Management Platform. The system should be able to handle the scanning of cookies on a domain and store this information in a database. Additionally, it should have an admin dashboard to manage cookies on various domains and an informative popup for visiting users on JP's domains.</p>

                    <p>In the fourth semester of my computer science education, we collaborated with a local company to develop a dashboard for managing and visualizing data from a large pool of various IoT devices. We selected a range of key figures in collaboration with Xtellio, and these figures were then visualized in various graphs for better understanding of one's device pool. The front-end was developed in Vue.js, and using a JavaScript API, we could fetch data from Xtellio's backend and modify it before sending it to the front-end.</p>
